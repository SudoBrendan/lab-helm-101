This workshop provides a hands-on introduction to Helm in OpenShift.

## Agenda

In this workshop, you'll:

1. Learn what Helm is, its objectives, a brief history, architecture, and limitations
1. Use the `helm` CLI to:
    - Query open source Helm charts online
    - Install Helm charts and their dependencies
    - Manage Helm YAML life cycles in OpenShift, including installing, upgrading, and uninstalling
1. Familiarize yourself with Helm charts by:
    - Building a Helm chart from scratch
    - Making edits to a Helm chart
    - Publishing your chart to a Helm repository
1. Have an opportunity to explore additional online resources to learn more

## Semantics

Throughout this course, the term "helm" can be a bit confusing because it means both: 1.) The name of an open source project, and 2.) the name of the CLI associated with that project. In this workshop, "Helm" will always mean the open source project, and "`helm`" will mean the CLI.
