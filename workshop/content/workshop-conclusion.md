## Continued Reading

While we hope this workshop was helpful in giving a hands-on experience with Helm, there's much more to learn. Here are a few links we'd recommend:

- [The official Helm documentation](https://helm.sh/docs/) is truly excellent, including its section on best practices.
- Check out some [Red Hat Helm charts](https://github.com/redhat-cop/helm-charts)!
- If Helm seems a bit too complex, you might try out [Kustomize](https://kustomize.io/) to manage your YAML for a template-free, what-you-see-is-what-you-get setup. Here are some [open source examples](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/kustomize/tree/master/examples).

## Closing

At Red Hat, we believe Open unlocks the world's potential - and that applies here too. If you have any feedback on this workshop, please bring it up with your Red Hat representative. You can also review this lab content at any time, it's completely [open source](https://github.com/SudoBrendan/lab-helm-101/workshop/content)!

Feel free to keep this page open and explore the resources above or play around with `helm` in the terminal. Alternatively, click `Finish Workshop` below to tear down your lab environment.
